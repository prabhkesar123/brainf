						<p>Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing complete</a>, </p>
						<p>it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.</p>
						<p>The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.</p>
						<p>Urban was highly influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%B2%E2%80%B2">P"</a> language which is referred as brainfuck's parent language and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-machine_model">The Infinite Abacus</a> which is referred as it's grandparent language.</p>

						<h3> </h3>
						<p><i>Brainfuck (not capitalized except at the start of a sentence) is an extremely minimal Turing-complete programming language with just 8 commands.

							You can try brainfuck on your browser with brainfuck-visualizer.</i>
							
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<pre>Any character not "><+-.,[]" (excluding quotation marks) is ignored.<br>

Brainfuck is represented by an array with 30,000 cells initialized to zero and a data pointer pointing at the current cell.
								
There are eight commands:
+ : Increments the value at the current cell by one.
- : Decrements the value at the current cell by one.
> : Moves the data pointer to the next cell (cell on the right).
< : Moves the data pointer to the previous cell (cell on the left).
. : Prints the ASCII value at the current cell (i.e. 65 = 'A').
, : Reads a single input character into the current cell.
[ : If the value at the current cell is zero, skips to the corresponding ] .
Otherwise, move to the next instruction.
] : If the value at the current cell is zero, move to the next instruction.
Otherwise, move backwards in the instructions to the corresponding [ .
								
[ and ] form a while loop. Obviously, they must be balanced.
								
et's look at some basic brainfuck programs.
								
++++++ [ > ++++++++++ < - ] > +++++ .
								
This program prints out the letter 'A'. First, it increments cell #1 to 6.
Cell #1 will be used for looping. Then, it enters the loop ([) and moves
to cell #2. It increments cell #2 10 times, moves back to cell #1, and
decrements cell #1. This loop happens 6 times (it takes 6 decrements for
cell #1 to reach 0, at which point it skips to the corresponding ] and
continues on).
								
At this point, we're on cell #1, which has a value of 0, while cell #2 has a
value of 60. We move on cell #2, increment 5 times, for a value of 65, and then
print cell #2's value. 65 is 'A' in ASCII, so 'A' is printed to the terminal.
								
								
, [ > + < - ] > .
								
This program reads a character from the user input and copies the character into
cell #1. Then we start a loop. Move to cell #2, increment the value at cell #2,
move back to cell #1, and decrement the value at cell #1. This continues on
until cell #1 is 0, and cell #2 holds cell #1's old value. Because we're on
cell #1 at the end of the loop, move to cell #2, and then print out the value
in ASCII.
								
Also keep in mind that the spaces are purely for readability purposes. You
could just as easily write it as:

,[>+<-]>.

Try and figure out what this program does:

,>,< [ > [ >+ >+ << -] >> [- << + >>] <<< -] >>

This program takes two numbers for input, and multiplies them.

The gist is it first reads in two inputs. Then it starts the outer loop,
conditioned on cell #1. Then it moves to cell #2, and starts the inner
loop conditioned on cell #2, incrementing cell #3. However, there comes a
problem: At the end of the inner loop, cell #2 is zero. In that case,
inner loop won't work anymore since next time. To solve this problem,
we also increment cell #4, and then recopy cell #4 into cell #2.
Then cell #3 is the result.

						<i><ul>Explanation:</ul>

						</i>
						<pre>
++       Cell c0 = 2
> +++++  Cell c1 = 5

[        Start your loops with your cell pointer on the loop counter (c1 in our case)
< + Add 1 to c0 > -      Subtract 1 from c1
]        End your loops with the cell pointer on the loop counter

At this point our program has added 5 to 2 leaving 7 in c0 and 0 in c1
BUT we cannot output this value to the terminal since it's not ASCII encoded!

To display the ASCII character "7" we must add 48 to the value 7!
48 = 6 * 8 so let's use another loop to help us!

++++ ++++  c1 = 8 and this will be our loop counter again
[
< +++ +++ Add 6 to c0 > -        Subtract 1 from c1
]
< .        Print out c0 which has the value 55 which translates to "7"!
